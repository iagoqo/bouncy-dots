## How to use

- Open the *index.html* file inside the *src* or *dist* directory with your browser

OR

- Serve the *src* or *dist* directory on a simple web server
- Access the *index.html* from the URL of your server

And then just click like mad everywhere! :)



## Gulp tasks

Before you can run gulp tasks you need to install the required Node.js packages. To do so, run:

    npm install


### Tasks

- `gulp test`: run unit tests
- `gulp build`: minifies the project and stores it in the *dist* directory
- `gulp clean`: cleans the *dist* directory
- `gulp (default)`: gulp clean + gulp build
